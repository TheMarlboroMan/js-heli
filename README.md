Small and unfinished clone of a handheld game I had (I think it was Super Cobra)

# what is missing

The original game had also two fire modes, rockets and bombs I think. There were also two destroyable things: rockets that would shoot up and fuel deposits that could be destroyed to recover fuel. I also think there were four stages. All of these are missing. 

# what's with the controls?

I remember the handheld controls being wonky and not responsive at all and I tried to reconstruct it. Maybe I overdid it, I no longer have the game, so it's hard to know.

# how to try it

Just load it in your browser, even using the http:// protocol.
